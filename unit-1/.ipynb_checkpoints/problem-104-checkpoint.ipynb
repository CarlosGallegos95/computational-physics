    "Consider a wind-tunnel simulation containing a spherical gas cloud with initial mass, $m_0=61.18026\\,\\rm g$. The cloud is embedded in a constant velocity vector field and can be tracked with three pigments. Pigment 1 traces the core of the cloud, pigment 2 the envelope of the cloud, and pigment 3 the more exterior shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "We carry out the simulation and extract some data on how much these pigments mixed in a data table (see file **simulation_data_hw1.txt**) with 4 columns (time, mixedmass1, mixedmass2, mixedmass3), where the first column indicates the time in units of $\\rm s$ and the last three columns provide the mass of mixed pigment gas, $m_{\\rm mix}$, in units of $\\rm g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Create a Python function to read in the simulation data and return four vector arrays containing: time, mixedmass1, mixedmass2, and mixedmass3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Make a single plot of $m_{\\rm mix}$ versus time of all three pigments. Which part of the cloud mixed the most?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Write a Python function that calculates the mixing fractions, $f_{\\rm mix}$, for each pigment, according to the following definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_{\\rm mix}=\\frac{m_{\\rm mix}}{m_0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixing fractions then represent the fraction of initial cloud mass that mixed in different layers.\n",
