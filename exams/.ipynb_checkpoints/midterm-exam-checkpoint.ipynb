    "(a) Go to the website of the sea level data base and search for measurments from Ecuador. Download the \"Research Quality\" \"hourly\" data for Santa Cruz. These data sets are **csv** files with 5 columns each (year, month, day, hour, sea level). The units of the sea level data are $\\rm mm$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Using pandas, read in the data from the data files and check the data by ploting the sea level measurement against the hours.\n",

    "(c) Remove extreme outliers from the data. Outliers show up as negative values that occur when instruments fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Calculate the average sea level at each hour for Santa Cruz and make a plot (average sea level against hours). What trend do you notice in the data?\n",
    "\n",
